Examples
=========

First two examples use FFCV to train machine learning models
to illustrate its ease of use as well as the significant gains in speed.
The next two examples cover how to use **custom transforms** in data loaders.


Finally, we provide a self-contained example repository for training ImageNet
quickly and accurately.
