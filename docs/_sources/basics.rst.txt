Getting started
===============

Working with FFCV just requires two steps:

1. :ref:`Converting an existing dataset into FFCV format<Writing a dataset to FFCV format>`, and
2. :ref:`Making FFCV data loaders <Making an FFCV dataloader>`.

In this section, we'll go over these steps one by one, and go from scratch to a
complete data loader ready for training.
