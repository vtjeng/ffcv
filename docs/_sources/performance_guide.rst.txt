Performance Guide
=================

In this section we'll go into a bit more detail about how to get the most out of
FFCV.

In :ref:`Working with Image Data in FFCV`, we give more details on working with image data,
including how to finetune to your specific resource requirements.

In the :ref:`Tuning Guide`, we give recommendations on how to optimize your
system for a couple of common use cases.

In :ref:`The Bottleneck Doctor`, we distill the concepts from the tuning
guide into a general map from the scarcest system resources to FFCV options.
